# ProwlPHP

## License
The project source forked from Fenric had no license information. My modifications, which is a rewrite of 80-90% of
the original source, are published under Apache 2.0 License. Read the LICENSE file for further information.

## Requirements
- PHP 5.3
- cURL with SSL support.

## Important
Versions below 1.0.0 support PHP 5.2, from release 1.0.0 on PHP 5.3 will be supported exclusively. You can use the 0.3.3 branch,
if you really need support for PHP 5.2, but I will only handle bug related issues on that branch, no feature requests.

## PEAR Channel
ProwlPHP can be installed from PEAR.

```
xenji@xenjibook:~/pear channel-discover xenji.github.com/ProwlPHP

xenji@xenjibook:~/pear install xenji/Prowl
```

## Documentation
This project is badly documented at the moment. The wiki at Fenric's repo has been switched off so I have to write the docs from the scratch. Please visit the wiki pages
from time to time to get updates. In the meantime you can take a look at the example.php, located in the examples directory.
This file shows the main functionality, but no extra stuff.

**Please remember to you use your own API keys - in the examples and in the unit tests. Thank you for not spamming me.**

## Changelog
